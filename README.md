# Arduino-Game
Game code for ENGR 103 final project

# What does this do?

This project is a tilt game that senses how much the Arduino CPX board has been tilted using the acceleration sensors, and lights up a NeoPixel corresponding to that value.
Your job is to tilt the board so that this red light lines up with an arbitrarily selected green light.
Press the right button at the correct time to win. If you press the right button and the two lights are not lined up, you fail, and start from the beginning.
