# Arduino Tilt Game
Game code for ENGR 103 final project

## Description

This arduino project creates a simple tilt game using the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express board. The built in accelerometer detects the tilt of the board, and a corresponding red NeoPixel light to indicate the direction of the tilt. Additionally, another green light is randomly displayed on the board. Your job is to line up the red light to the green light, and press the right button to win-- press it at the wrong time, and the game restarts. Score successfully 20 times in a row, and you win!
